    2. Prepare the Dry Ingredients:
     - In a medium mixing bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

    3. Cream the Butter and Sugar:
     - In a separate large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.

    4. Add Eggs and Vanilla:
     - Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

    6. Bake the Cake:
     - Pour the cake batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top.
     - Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

    7. Cool the Cake:
     - Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.

   For the Chocolate Icing:

    2. Add Boiling Water and Melted Butter:

   To Assemble the Lamingtons:

     - Dip each cake square into the chocolate icing, ensuring all sides are coated.

 ## Pavlova
  Cooking Pavlova in Australia is a cherished tradition, and it's a delicious and iconic dessert that's perfect for special occasions and celebrations. Pavlova is a meringue-based dessert with a crisp outer shell and a soft, marshmallow-like center, typically topped with whipped cream and fresh fruits. Here's a classic recipe to guide you through making a scrumptious Pavlova:

  **Ingredients**:
   - 4 large egg whites, at room temperature
   - 1 cup caster sugar (superfine sugar)
   - 1 teaspoon cornstarch (cornflour)
   - 1 teaspoon white vinegar
   - 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
   - 1 cup heavy cream (whipping cream), chilled
   - Fresh fruits (such as berries, kiwi, passion fruit, or mango), for topping

  **Instructions**:

   1. Preheat the Oven:
    - Preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Draw a circle (about 8-9 inches in diameter) on the parchment paper as a guide for shaping the Pavlova.

   2. Beat the Egg Whites:
   - In a clean mixing bowl, start beating the egg whites with an electric mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form.

   3. Add Sugar Gradually:
    - Gradually add the caster sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time, while continuing to beat the egg whites. Make sure the sugar is fully incorporated before adding more.
    - Continue to beat until the egg whites are glossy and stiff peaks form. The mixture should hold its shape when you lift the beaters.

   4. Add Cornstarch, Vinegar, and Vanilla:
    - Sift the cornstarch over the egg white mixture, then add the white vinegar and vanilla extract.
    - Gently fold the ingredients into the meringue using a spatula. Be careful not to deflate the mixture.

   5. Shape the Pavlova:
    - Spoon the meringue onto the prepared baking sheet, within the drawn circle. Use the back of the spoon to create a shallow well in the center of the meringue, which will hold the toppings later.

   6. Bake the Pavlova:
    - Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and immediately reduce the temperature to 250°F (120°C).
    - Bake the Pavlova for about 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until the outside is crisp and dry. The center should be soft and marshmallow-like.
    - Turn off the oven and leave the Pavlova inside with the door slightly ajar to cool slowly for about an hour.

   7. Top the Pavlova:
    - Whip the chilled heavy cream until it forms stiff peaks.
    - Gently spread the whipped cream over the cooled Pavlova.
    - Top the Pavlova with an assortment of fresh fruits, such as berries, kiwi, passion fruit, or mango. Arrange the fruits creatively on top of the whipped cream.

   8. Serve and Enjoy:
    - Transfer the Pavlova to a serving platter and serve immediately.

  Pavlova is a delightful and show-stopping dessert that's beloved in Australia and beyond. Its light and airy texture, combined with the sweetness of the meringue and the freshness of the fruits, make it a true crowd-pleaser. Enjoy your homemade Australian Pavlova with family and friends on any special occasion!

    - In a separate skillet, heat a little butter or vegetable oil over medium heat.

   4. Assemble the Kiwi Burger:
    - Toast the hamburger buns if desired.
    - On the bottom half of each bun, place a cooked beef patty with melted cheese.
    - Top each patty with a slice of cooked beetroot, followed by lettuce leaves, tomato slices, and onion slices.
